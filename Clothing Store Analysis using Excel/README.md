I crafted a dynamic and insightful report using Excel, incorporating a total of six charts to visually represent key data trends. Three of these charts are dynamic donut charts, adding a touch of interactivity, while the other three leverage pivot tables for a deeper dive into the numbers, resulting in a comprehensive report across six individual sheets
